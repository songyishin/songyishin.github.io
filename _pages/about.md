I am a second-year PhD student in Economics at [University of Virginia](https://economics.virginia.edu/).
My research interests lie in applied microeconomics with a specific focus on marginalized/underprivileged groups.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a research associate in [Korea Development Institute](https://www.kdi.re.kr/eng/), mainly analyzing data to evaluate female labor market policies.
